# ChatGPT ServiceTitan API Assistant

This is a simple chrome extension to demo ChatGPT assistant for not so documented ServiceTitan API.
Extension was 80% done by ChatGPT4, I'm just asking it questions and copy pasting the answers :) 

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable developer mode

# Caveats
- ChatGPT is trained on old API docs, so it will answer with V1 API instead of V2.
- You'll be charged for the API calls.
